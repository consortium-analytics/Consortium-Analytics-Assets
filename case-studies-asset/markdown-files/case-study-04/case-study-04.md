## 1. Introduction

Spreadsheets have become one of the most critical tools in the modern business landscape, transforming how organizations process data, make decisions, and drive growth. From simple calculations to complex financial modeling, spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and others have revolutionized industries and business functions. This case study explores the historical evolution, impact, and transformative effects of spreadsheets on both the economy and businesses across the globe.

## 2. History of Spreadsheets

### Early Beginnings (1960s–1970s)

The origins of spreadsheets can be traced back to the 1960s, when early computers were used for accounting and financial tasks in rudimentary forms. The first significant step toward a digital spreadsheet came with the development of **VisiCalc** in 1979 by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston. It was the first electronic spreadsheet, designed to help businesses handle complex financial calculations more efficiently than manual ledger entries. VisiCalc quickly gained popularity, especially in the accounting industry, and was pivotal in the widespread adoption of personal computers for business.

### The Rise of Lotus 1-2-3 (1980s)

In the early 1980s, **Lotus 1-2-3** emerged as a more powerful spreadsheet tool, incorporating features like graphing, database management, and extensive mathematical functions. Lotus 1-2-3 was one of the most influential software products of the era, leading the way for the development of modern spreadsheet applications.

### Microsoft Excel (1985–Present)

Launched in 1985, **Microsoft Excel** took the spreadsheet to the next level, providing a user-friendly interface, greater data processing power, and an integration with other office productivity tools. By the late 1990s, Excel became the dominant spreadsheet software in the business world, offering advanced capabilities such as pivot tables, macros, and complex functions that allowed businesses to streamline their operations.

With the advent of cloud computing, **Google Sheets** was introduced in 2006 as an online alternative to Excel, further democratizing spreadsheet usage across individuals and small businesses. Google Sheets offered collaboration features, real-time editing, and cloud-based data storage, which made spreadsheets more accessible and collaborative than ever.
