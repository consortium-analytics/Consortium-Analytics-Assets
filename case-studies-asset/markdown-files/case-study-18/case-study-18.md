## How Businesses Do Social Media Marketing:

Businesses engage in social media marketing through various strategies, including organic content creation, paid advertising, and influencer collaborations.

- **Organic Content Creation:** Businesses post content that resonates with their audience, including blog posts, videos, infographics, and customer reviews. This content helps build a community around the brand.
